My learning journey at AltSchool - Linux, Cloud, DevOps

# 🎓 AltSchool Learning Journey – Cloud Engineering Track

Welcome! This repository is where I document everything I'm learning at [AltSchool Africa](https://altschoolafrica.com), as I work toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer**.

I’m using this repo to track my weekly progress, share useful Linux commands, explore SSH, permissions, and eventually dive into real-world DevOps and cloud tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS.

## 📅 Weekly Learning Progress

### ✅ Week 1: Linux Basics
- Learned how to use the terminal and navigate the Linux file system
- Practiced commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `touch`, `mkdir`, and `rm`
